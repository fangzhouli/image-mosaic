# Image Mosaic Algorithm Implementation

## Description

This is a course project of ECS170 COmputer Vision taught by Prof. Yong Jae Lee at UC Davis. In this project, me and [Timothy Zhang](https://github.com/3tz) implemented image mosaic algorithm by applying image warping, homography, and RANSAC techniques.

## Testing

In order to reproduce our results, you can run the scripts,
- generate_mosaic.m, and
- test_ransac.m,
in src directory.

## Results
